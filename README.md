# Vendor_Performance_Analysis-SQL-Python-PowerBI
This project analyzes retail vendor performance and inventory management using SQL, Python, and Power BI. It uncovers insights on vendor profitability, inventory risks, and cost optimization while providing interactive dashboards for decision-making.

# Objective

This project focuses on evaluating vendor performance, profitability, and inventory management to enable data-driven purchasing and sales decisions.

# Key Contributions

## SQL ETL Pipeline Development
Designed and optimized an advanced SQL-based ETL workflow to merge and summarize data from multiple sources. Leveraged CTEs and filtering techniques to boost query performance and minimize processing time for large datasets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Hypothesis Testing
Applied Python-based data analysis and hypothesis testing to investigate vendor profitability, pricing strategies, and inventory turnover patterns.

## Insights on Vendor Dependence & Inventory Risk
Discovered over-reliance on the top 10 vendors (accounting for 65.7% of purchases) and identified $2.71M worth of unsold inventory linked to underperforming vendors. Proposed diversification strategies and inventory optimization measures.

## Interactive Power BI Dashboards
Built dynamic dashboards in Power BI to track vendor performance, profit margins, bulk purchasing impact (72% cost savings), and generate actionable insights for decision-makers.
